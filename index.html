    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>Wintour was born in Hampstead, London in 1949, to Charles Wintour (1917–1999), editor of the Evening Standard,
        and Eleanor "Nonie" Trego Baker (1917–1995), an American, the daughter of a Harvard Law School professor. Her
        parents married in 1940 and divorced in 1979. Wintour was named after her maternal grandmother, Anna Baker (née
        Gilkyson), a merchant's daughter from Pennsylvania. Audrey Slaughter, a magazine editor who founded publications
        such as Honey and Petticoat, is her stepmother.In her youth, Wintour was educated at the independent North
        London Collegiate School, where she frequently rebelled against the dress code by taking up the hemlines of her
        skirts. At the age of 14, she began wearing her hair in a bob. She developed an interest in fashion as a regular
        viewer of Cathy McGowan on Ready Steady Go!, and from the issues of Seventeen which her grandmother sent from
        the United States. "Growing up in London in the '60s, you'd have to have had Irving Penn's sack over your head
        not to know something extraordinary was happening in fashion," she recalled. Her father regularly consulted her
        when he was considering ideas for increasing readership in the youth market. At the age of 15, she began dating
        well-connected older men. She was involved briefly with Piers Paul Read, then 24. In her later teens, she and
        gossip columnist Nigel Dempster became a fixture on the London club circuit.</p>
    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>After working as a fashion editor for a series of New York magazines, she served as editor (1986) of <em>
            British Vogue</em> and as editor (1987) of House & Garden, which she controversially relaunched in the
        United States as HG.

        In 1988 Wintour replaced Grace Mirabella as editor in chief at <em>American Vogue</em>. The move came three
        years after the American launch of the French magazine Elle, which consistently threatened to reduce Vogue’s
        circulation and advertising revenue. In explaining her publishing philosophy of democratic fashion fantasy,
        Wintour remarked, “Mass with class—that’s my mantra.” Her <em>Vogue</em> covers began featuring prominent
        women (including actresses Nicole Kidman and Angelina Jolie and politician Hillary Clinton) rather than
        exclusively using models.

        Under Wintour’s direction, Condé Nast Publications—<em>Vogue’s</em> parent company—launched several
        spin-offs, most notably <em>Teen Vogue</em> (1993). Meanwhile, Wintour orchestrated a spate of high-profile
        philanthropic <em>Vogue associations</em>, including the transformation of the New York Metropolitan Museum
        of Art’s annual Costume Institute Ball fund-raising gala (of which she served as cochair) from an elite
        gathering of Manhattan socialites into an internationally chronicled celebrity-dominated red-carpet event
        known as the “East Coast’s answer to the Oscars.”</p>

    <h2>Real Devil in Prada?</h2>
    <p>In addition to such achievements, Wintour was also known for her imperious demeanour, which was heightened by her
        propensity to sport dark sunglasses. <strong>The Devil Wears Prada (2004)</strong>, the best-selling novel by
        Lauren Weisberger that in 2006 was adapted into a popular film starring Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway, is an
        account of the comic travails of one of the personal assistants of the fictional fashion magazine editor Miranda
        Priestly. The Priestly character was widely believed to have been a caricature of Wintour, for whom Weisberger
        once worked. In 2009 Wintour appeared in The September Issue: Anna Wintour & the Making of Vogue, a documentary
        film about the creation of the September 2007 issue of the magazine.</p>
